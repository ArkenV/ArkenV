- 👋 Hi, I’m Danny Betancourt @ComputerScientistDanny
- 👀 I’m interested in melding things together.
- 🌱 I'm always working on something. It's not always public, but I'd be happy to chat about it if you're curious.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaboration!
- 📫 Feel free to [get in touch!](https://linqapp.com/dannybetancourt)
